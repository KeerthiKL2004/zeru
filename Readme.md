# DeFi Wallet Credit Scoring using Aave V2 Transactions

This project develops a machine learning model to assign credit scores (ranging from 0 to 1000) to DeFi wallets based on user behavior on the Aave V2 protocol. The data is derived from approximately 100,000 wallet transactions and focuses on actions such as deposits, borrows, repayments, redemptions, and liquidations.

## Dataset

The original dataset file `user-wallet-transactions.json` (approximately 40MB) contains 100,000 records from Aave V2 protocol interactions. Due to GitHub's file size limits, the dataset is not included in the repository.

**Download it from Google Drive**:  
[Download the dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nv_H9Z5I0mJrMVrlNYET-saYvg9q9KXP?usp=drive_link)

Place the downloaded file inside the `data/` folder as:

```
data/user-wallet-transactions.json
```

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zeru-credit-score.git
cd zeru-credit-score
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate virtual environment:
# For Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, create it with the following content:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

### 4. Run the Pipeline

#### Generate Credit Scores

```bash
python main.py
```

#### Visualize the Results

```bash
python visualize.py
```

## Output

- `credit_scores.csv`: Contains the computed credit scores (0–1000) for each wallet.
- Graphs generated by `visualize.py`:
  - Action Distribution
  - Top Wallets by Transaction Count
  - Credit Score Distribution
  - Average Score by Action Type

## Methodology

The scoring algorithm is a behavior-based scoring system inspired by traditional credit scoring logic. Key steps:

- Feature extraction from transaction types:
  - Deposit count
  - Borrow count
  - Repayment count
  - Redemption count
  - Liquidation count
- Scores are computed using a weighted formula that rewards responsible actions (like repaying) and penalizes risky ones (like liquidation).
- Final scores are normalized to fit within a 0–1000 scale.

| Wallet Address                            | Credit Score |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 0x123...abcd                              | 845          |
| 0x456...def0                              | 430          |
| ...                                       | ...          |

## Notes

- The model is heuristic-based and does not integrate market price feeds or external credit data.
- Credit scores are computed based solely on on-chain activity within Aave V2.
- This project is intended for learning and evaluation purposes.
